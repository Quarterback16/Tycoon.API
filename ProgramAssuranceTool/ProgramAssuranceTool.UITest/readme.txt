This folder contains Selenium IDE Test Scripts
It is a pre-recorded user action for testing the website, it contains the assertion to validate the page against the Display Rules or Business Rules.

This script can be run automatically to perform those checking and validation and therefor saving the time tremendeously compare to if we do it manually.

This test script run on Firefox browser only and at the time of writing this I'm using Firefox version 23.0.1

The tools to create this test script are firefox pluggins, such as:
- Selenium IDE 2.5.0; this is the main component to create & run the test scripts.
- Test Results (Selenium IDE) 1.17; this is to generate the test result in html file.
