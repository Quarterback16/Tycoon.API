There are 2 ways of using this app.

1. Use default testing Twitter login:

I created screen name TweetTesterNET.  You can use TweetTesterNET to read 
tweets and retweets by TweetTesterNET's friends (users that TweetTesterNET follows).

TwitterCredentials.json contains a TweetTesterNET app's credentials.

GroupSettings.json contains groups and users that I have defined as an example of grouping.
Yon can add / edit group names in GroupSettings.json.  At runtime, you can move users around
the groups.

2. Use your own Twitter login:

Go to: https://apps.twitter.com/

Sign in and create a new app under your Twitter login. 
Copy values for following 4 items to TwitterCredentials.json.

Consumer Key (API Key)
Consumer Secret (API Secret)
Access Token
Access Token Secret

ScreenName in TwitterCredentials.json is for reference only.  
The values in TwitterCredentials.json will be deserialized to class TwitterCredentials at runtime.
